# Ignite Courses Vault
A repository dedicated to storing all the projects developed during the Ignite program.

## First, What is Ignite?
Ignite is a private specialization provided by Rocketseat, focused on teach the most modern tools and technologies of the programming market. During this program, I've studied technologies like: ReactJS & NextJS, NodeJS & NestJS and DevOps practices.

## Get started
This repository is divided by technologies and you can access it clicking on the links below. Each part has your own `projects` and `challenges` folder. The "projects" folders are the projects that I made with the course instructor while watching the classes and learning the technology. The "challenges" folders are the projects that I made by myself after finishing the respective project (without consulting the classes). For instance, after watching a certain amount of classes creating and finishing the `project-01`, the Rocketseat leaves a documentation (or figma layout) that contains some instructions to complete the `challenge-01`, which is a project to be maded without any classes, just to practice what you've learned in the module.
